    <h1>MAKE <span style="color: orangered;">A DONATION</span> </h1>
    <p>South Africa has one of the most unequal school systems in the world. Following decades of apartheid, millions of Black and Coloured South Africans live in forgotten townships and rural underserved communities distanced from economic hubs – resulting in a lack of employment opportunities and demoralized community leadership, as well as access to education and digital infrastructure.This reality does not have to be our future. Together, we can level the playing field to ensure all youth have equitable access to high-quality education across not only South Africa – but the entire African continent. When our youth thrive, we all thrive. We need you to join us by being a part of the solution. Donate and help us secure the future for young South Africans today. </p>
